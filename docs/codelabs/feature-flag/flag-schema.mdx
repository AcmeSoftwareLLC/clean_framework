# Understanding the OpenFeature JSON Schema

[ðŸ‘‰  flag.json](https://github.com/AcmeSoftwareLLC/clean_framework/blob/codelabs/assets/flags.json)

The following JSON is based on [OpenFeature Schema](https://github.com/open-feature/schemas/blob/main/json-schema/flagd-definitions.json).
It includes three flag keys:
1. **newTitle:** Since the flag doesn't contain variants, so it behaves as a boolean flag.
  Here the state is enabled so the flag resolves to `true`.

2. **color:** Since `returnType` is defined as "number", it resolves to a numeric value.
  There are four variants: "red", "green", "blue" & "orange" that the flag could resolve to.
  If any rule condition matches for the provided context then the variant in "action" object is resolved.
  For instance, if the provided email is `user@feature.test`, then it'll match with the second rule,
  which resolves to "red" variant. That means, the resulting value for the flag will be `4294901760`.
  And if the provided email doesn't match with any of the rules then a defaultVariant is used, which is "blue".

3. **increment:** The flag is similar to color. For instance, if email is `user@feature.test` then
  the flag will be resolved to value `3`. The value is used as a increment factor in the app.
