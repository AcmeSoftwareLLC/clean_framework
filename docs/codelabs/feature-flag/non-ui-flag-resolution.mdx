# Evaluating flags in non-UI code
The `OpenFeatureClient` class can be used to evaluate flags in non-UI code.
Let's head to `counter_page.dart` where we have `incrementCounter` method that is responsible
for incrementing the counter. Here, we'll make it so that the increment factor is decided based on
the email of user.

Update the method as given below:

```dart
Future<void> _incrementCounter() async {
  final client = OpenFeature.instance.getClient();
  final increment = await client.getNumberValue(
    key: 'increment',
    defaultValue: 1,
    context: EvaluationContext({'email': widget.email ?? ''}),
  );

  _counter += increment as int;
  setState(() {});
}
```

The evaluation process is similar to that of previous step. For instance, if you login with email
`user@feature.flag` then the flag will be resolved with "double" variant. Thus, will increment the
counter by 2 in each tap of the FAB.
