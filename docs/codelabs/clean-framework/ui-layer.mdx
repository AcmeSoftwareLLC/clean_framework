# The UI Layer: UI, Presenter and View Model

Lets discuss the components of the UI Layer in more detail.

<Image src="/assets/ui_layer.png" caption="UI Layers"/>

As mentioned on the previous topic,
the UI component resides in the most external layer of the architecture.
This means that the UI layer is related to specific libraries that make up the frontend of the application,
in our case, the Flutter widgets libraries.

When building an app using Clean Framework,
we try to separate any code that is not related to pure UI logic from the UI itself as much as possible, and instead we put it in the Presenter (to send and receive data from internal layers)
and the Use Case (the normal location for business logic).

The Clean Framework UI class behaves like a Stateless Widget.
Stateful widgets are rarely used, since the state usage for important data breaks the layer rules.
Try to avoid using Stateful widgets whenever possible, to avoid breaking the Clean Architecture rules for layers.

All UI implementations require at least one View Model to fetch data from the entities.
This data comes from Use Case Outputs, which Presenters receive and translate as needed.

The feature you write can be expressed in multiple screens presented to the user,
and can even include small widgets that are inserted into other screens.
These are your entry points to the feature, and as such,
will require the UI to listen to the state changes of the feature's Use Case through its Outputs.
In other words, Use Cases can have multiple Outputs that can have relationships with many View Models through the Presenters.

View Models are immutable classes which are almost pure PODOs (Plain Old Dart Objects).
We try to keep them as lean as possible, as their only responsibility is the passing of digested data to the UI object.

View Models tend to only contain Strings.
This is intentional, as the Presenter holds the responsibility of performing any formatting or parsing of the data before being passed to the UI.

Finally, the purpose of the Presenter is to connect and listen to Use Case Providers, to interact with the Use Case instance,
to handle and pass user interaction events from the UI (through callbacks on the View Model),
and to trigger rebuilds on the UI when the state changes, causing a new Output to be generated.
This will be explained in greater detail later, so for now just assume the Presenters associate with only one type of Output.

The most important job of the Presenter is to translate data from an Output,
and to create a new View Model everytime a new Output is received.

### Codelab
To better understand the flow and project structure,
we'll create an application that will fetch data from a service and display it on a screen.

For this example, we will use the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

### Coding the UI Layer

After a feature folder is created, any developer will probably try to start adding Flutter Widgets to build up the code requirements.
This framework is flexible enough to allow you to start coding components that don't require access to,
or even knowledge of, any external dependency (databases, services, cache, etc), because those concerns belong to other layers.

The simplest way to start working on a new feature is to first decide how many UI elements will be required to complete the implementation of the feature.

### The feature requirements

We are going to write a very simple feature which can be explained in a few Gherkin scenarios:


```gherkin
Given I have navigated to the Home feature
Then I will see the list of Pokemon
And I will see a search bar
When I type a Pokemon name on the search bar
Then I will see the list of Pokemon filtered by the search term
```

And this is the desired design of the page, which we can use as a reference.

The first step is to create a view model with the properties that the feature requires.
Let's create one in the `lib/features/home/presentation` directory:

#### lib/features/home/presentation/home_view_model.dart
```dart
class HomeViewModel extends ViewModel {
  const HomeViewModel({
    required this.pokemons,
    required this.isLoading,
    required this.hasFailedLoading,
    required this.onRetry,
    required this.onRefresh,
    required this.onSearch,
  });

  final List<PokemonViewModel> pokemons;
  final bool isLoading;
  final bool hasFailedLoading;

  final VoidCallback onRetry;
  final AsyncCallback onRefresh;
  final ValueChanged<String> onSearch;

  @override
  List<Object?> get props => [pokemons, isLoading, hasFailedLoading];
}

class PokemonViewModel extends ViewModel {
  const PokemonViewModel({
    required this.name,
    required this.imageUrl,
  });

  final String name;
  final String imageUrl;

  @override
  List<Object?> get props => [name, imageUrl];
}
```

The next step is to create a Presenter.
This class will be responsible for listening to the Use Case outputs and creating the View Model.
In order to create the Presenter, we will first need to create the base structure of our domain layer:
the `Entity`, `Output`, and `UseCase` classes.

Note: For now, we're only creating the skeleton of the Use Case. We won't be writing any business logic yet.

Let's create these three classes in the `lib/features/home/domain` directory:

#### lib/features/home/domain/home_entity.dart
```dart
class HomeEntity extends Entity {
  @override
  List<Object?> get props => [];
}
```

#### lib/features/home/domain/home_ui_output.dart
```dart
class HomeUIOutput extends Output {
  @override
  List<Object?> get props => [];
}
```

#### lib/features/home/domain/home_use_case.dart
```dart
class HomeUseCase extends UseCase<HomeEntity> {
  HomeUseCase() : super(
    entity: HomeEntity(),
    transformers: [
      OutputTransformer.from((_) => HomeUIOutput()),
    ],
  );
}
```

After creating the `UseCase` skeleton, let's create a provider for it in the `lib/providers.dart` file:

#### lib/providers.dart
```dart
final homeUseCaseProvider = UseCaseProvider(HomeUseCase.new);
```

Now let's create the Presenter in the `lib/features/home/presentation` directory:

### lib/features/home/presentation/home_presenter.dart
```dart
class HomePresenter extends Presenter<HomeViewModel, HomeUIOutput, HomeUseCase> {
  HomePresenter({
    super.key,
    required super.builder,
  }) : super(provider: homeUseCaseProvider);

  @override
  HomeViewModel createViewModel(HomeUseCase useCase, HomeUIOutput output) {
    const spriteBaseUrl = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/other/dream-world';

    return HomeViewModel(
      pokemons: const [
        PokemonViewModel(name: 'Bulbasaur', imageUrl: '$spriteBaseUrl/1.svg'),
        PokemonViewModel(name: 'Charmander', imageUrl: '$spriteBaseUrl/4.svg'),
        PokemonViewModel(name: 'Squirtle', imageUrl: '$spriteBaseUrl/7.svg'),
        PokemonViewModel(name: 'Pikachu', imageUrl: '$spriteBaseUrl/25.svg'),
      ],
      onSearch: (query) {},
      onRefresh: () async {},
      onRetry: () {},
      isLoading: false,
      hasFailedLoading: false,
    );
  }
}
```

Now we can create the UI class in the `lib/features/home/presentation` directory:

#### lib/features/home/presentation/home_ui.dart
```dart
class HomeUI extends UI<HomeViewModel> {
  HomeUI({super.key});

  @override
  HomePresenter create(PresenterBuilder<HomeViewModel> builder) {
    return HomePresenter(builder: builder);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, HomeViewModel viewModel) {
    final textTheme = Theme.of(context).textTheme;

    Widget child;
    if (viewModel.isLoading) {
      child = const Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
    } else if (viewModel.hasFailedLoading) {
      child = _LoadingFailed(onRetry: viewModel.onRetry);
    } else {
      child = RefreshIndicator(
        onRefresh: viewModel.onRefresh,
        child: Scrollbar(
          thumbVisibility: true,
          child: ListView.builder(
            prototypeItem: const SizedBox(height: 176), // 160 + 16
            padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 16),
            itemBuilder: (context, index) {
              final pokemon = viewModel.pokemons[index];

              return PokemonCard(
                key: ValueKey(pokemon.name),
                imageUrl: pokemon.imageUrl,
                name: pokemon.name,
                heroTag: pokemon.name,
                onTap: () { /*TODO: Navigate to detail page*/ },
              );
            },
            itemCount: viewModel.pokemons.length,
          ),
        ),
      );
    }

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: const Text('Pokémon'),
        centerTitle: false,
        titleTextStyle: textTheme.displaySmall!.copyWith(
          fontWeight: FontWeight.w300,
        ),
        bottom: viewModel.isLoading || viewModel.hasFailedLoading
            ? null
            : PokemonSearchField(onChanged: viewModel.onSearch),
      ),
      body: child,
    );
  }
}

class _LoadingFailed extends StatelessWidget {
  const _LoadingFailed({required this.onRetry});

  final VoidCallback onRetry;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(
      child: Column(
        children: [
          Text(
            'Oops, loading failed.',
            style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.displaySmall,
          ),
          const SizedBox(height: 24),
          OutlinedButton(
            onPressed: onRetry,
            child: const Text('Help Flareon, find her friends'),
          ),
          const SizedBox(height: 64),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Finally, we should provide the `HomeUI` as the home for the app.

Note: Remember to add `AppProviderScope` as the top level widget,
which will hold the state of all the providers created by the app.

#### lib/main.dart
```dart
void main() {
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return AppProviderScope(
      child: MaterialApp(
        title: 'Pokemon',
        theme: ThemeData.from(
          colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: Colors.red),
          useMaterial3: true,
        ),
        home: HomeUI(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

At this point the app should run perfectly fine with the static data we added in the view model.

Hopefully, by now you can appreciate the capacity of the Clean Framework components
to help developers work with the UI layer without the need to first finish the Domain Layer code.
You can even work in parallel with another developer that is doing it,
while also having a high coverage on your code.

It has to be noted that this is very helpful to create MVP builds
and have a working prototype that can be reviewed by stakeholders and QA teams,
saving the development team a lot of headaches, since the feedback can be received sooner.
